# DoubledMNIST
Dataset for offline handwritter character recognition.

In this paper we provide new dataset which should be the successor
to the popular MNIST. This dataset is duplicated in relation to MNIST
and switcihg architecture to DoubledMNIST should be real check
of knowledge in machine learning tasks. Couse of really good data
preparation and dimensions of dataset, with good architecture we
expect that precision should be close 1. 

Its dimensions: 140 000 images, resolution 56x56 of each.
Read the one page paper for detailed description.

Notbook DoubledMNIST.ipynb contains source code of dataset creation.

Notebook LoadUtil_DoubledMNIST.ipynb contaions util function to unziping dataset to your project and create train and test set of images.

Folder /paper contain one page descritpition of dataset.
